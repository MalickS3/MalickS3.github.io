	<p><em>As an everyday challenge that will keeps growing, my project will try to predict traffic patterns in New York City. This will hopefully lead to a better understanding of future traffic conditions based on historical observations..

    Traffic forecasting is an important component of planning, design and operations for any city transportation network. According to the DOT, highway design and planning are usually based on estimates of traffic 20 years beyond the construction date. So while no one knows the future, trained traffic forecasters and modelers use special tools and experience to estimate these numbers

  The most common existing solution is to use the traditional four steps transportation modeling which are (Trip generation, Trip distribution, Mode choice and Route assignment). Another solution is to use Travel demand modeling involves a series of mathematical models that attempt to simulate human behavior while traveling.
